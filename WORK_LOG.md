| Jan 16  | 10:50 - 11:35 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I continued to think about strategies and started coding first attempt. |
| Jan 23  | 10:30 - 11:00 | I started over now knowing that I need an adjacency list. I set up my array of arraylists for each day. I also added 2 for loops to go through each temperature and to find how many greater temperatures there are after that temperate and adding it to the arraylist in the adjecency list I made before. I also added pseudocode from the theory slide to a findlongest method a made that I will use recursively. |

| Jan 23  | 11:30 - 12:00 |                            I found two errors. The first one was because I was putting in the actual temperatures instead of the indices of the temperatures. The second error was return the longest run of the last temperature not the longest out of all the temperature so i added math.max using the previous longest and the current longest being looked and set the longest to which one of those was longer. |
