| Jan 23  | 10:30 - 11:00 | I started over now knowing that I need an adjacency list. I set up my array of arraylists for each day. I also added 2 for loops to go through each temperature and to find how many greater temperatures there are after that temperate and adding it to the arraylist in the adjecency list I made before. I also added pseudocode from the theory slide to a findlongest method a made that I might use recursively. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
